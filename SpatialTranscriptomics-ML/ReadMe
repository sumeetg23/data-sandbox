Spatial transcriptomics data using both conventional neural networks and graph neural networks. It enables researchers to leverage spatial context and gene expression jointly to predict cell clusters or cell types.

Features:
- Input your own .h5ad spatial transcriptomics data or use a built-in demo dataset
- Train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using expression data ± spatial coordinates
- Train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using spatial proximity graphs
- Compare model performance via accuracy metrics
- Visualize spatial prediction maps

Usage:
  python spatial_classify.py --input path/to/data.h5ad --output output_dir --include_coords

  --input : Path to input .h5ad spatial transcriptomics dataset. If omitted, a demo dataset is used.
  --output : Directory to save models, plots, and outputs (required).
  --include_coords : Include spatial coordinates as features for the MLP model.

This project implements machine learning models to classify spatial transcriptomics data. It includes:
- Data loading: Accepts user-provided .h5ad single-cell spatial transcriptomics datasets or, if input data not specified then uses a built-in demo dataset from Squidpy.
- Preprocessing: Extracts gene expression features and optionally spatial coordinates; performs clustering if cluster labels are missing.
- Models:
  1. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier that uses tabular features (expression ± spatial coordinates).
  2. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier that constructs a spatial proximity graph and uses graph convolutions to predict cell cluster labels.
- Training: Trains both models with standard training loops, including train/test splitting for MLP.
- Evaluation: Reports accuracy for both models on the dataset.
- Visualization: Saves spatial plots of predicted clusters.

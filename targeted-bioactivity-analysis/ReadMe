This Jupyter Notebook performs a bioactivity and drug-likeness analysis on compounds targeting the SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase (ChEMBL3927) using RDKit, ChEMBL API, and statistical analysis. Here's a concise summary of each step:

1. Data Retrieval
Uses ChEMBL web client to:
- Search for the 3C-like proteinase target (CHEMBL3927).
- Retrieve all compound bioactivity data (specifically IC50) for this target.

2. Data Cleaning & Classification
Filters out compounds with missing IC50 values. Classifies compounds based on IC50:
- Active: IC50 ≤ 1000 nM
- Inactive: IC50 ≥ 10000 nM
- Intermediate: Between 1000 and 10000 nM

3. Feature Calculation (Lipinski’s Rule)
Computes four key Lipinski drug-likeness descriptors from SMILES using RDKit:
- Molecular Weight (MW)
- LogP (lipophilicity)
- Number of H-bond Donors
- Number of H-bond Acceptors

4. Bioactivity Normalization
Caps extreme IC50 values to avoid distortion. Converts IC50 to pIC50 (more suitable for analysis)
pIC50 = −log10(IC50 in M)

5. Visualization
Bar plots: Distribution of compounds by bioactivity class.
Scatter plot: MW vs. LogP colored by class and sized by pIC50.
Box plots: Distribution of pIC50 across bioactivity classes.

6. Statistical Analysis
Uses Kruskal-Wallis test to assess if bioactivity class groups differ significantly across:
- pIC50
- MW
- LogP
- H-bond Donors
- H-bond Acceptors

Plots corresponding boxplots and outputs results to CSV.
